We were a little late in submitting our code. Feel free to check the Git-Hub repository above for a final version of the code


This code is organized as following: 
* The BeatSegmenter folder contain the model used to predict the position of each R-wave in raw ECG's. 
* The BeatAnnoter folder contain the model used to classify the type of each beats.
* Each model folder contain a Model sub-folder for trainned model's weights and training performances tracking. Edit: weights of models are removed of the archive for weight purposes but are available on the Git repository.
* Each model have a Training.py file who contain the training procedure
* Each model's folder contain associated notebook to show the learning evolution and some code to test the model
